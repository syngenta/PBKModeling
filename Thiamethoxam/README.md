# Git Repository for Avian PBK Modeling of Thiamethoxam

## Description

> **Note** More detailed information is provided in the submitted Thiamethoxam PBK manuscript.
>
> This project presented a case study for thiamethoxam in three avian species, demonstrating the potential of physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modeling to
> improve ecotoxicological study design, enable extrapolations that inform hazard characterization in risk assessment, and reduce the use of animal testing.
