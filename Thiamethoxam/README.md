## Description

> **Note** More detailed information is provided in the Thiamethoxam avian PBK publication.
>
> This project presented a case study for thiamethoxam in three avian species, demonstrating the potential of physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modeling to
> enable cross-species and cross-route extrapolations that inform hazard characterization in risk assessment, and reduce the use of animal testing.
